Here I present the certificates I have earned through RangeForce, where I completed over 47 hours of hands-on cybersecurity training. 
These labs have strengthened my practical skills across various areas, including SIEM tools, Microsoft Sentinel, Azure, Linux, Splunk, malware analysis. 

These certifications reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my drive to stay proficient in key technologies and practices essential for a SOC analyst role. 
Each module provided valuable, real-world scenarios to enhance my technical abilities in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring.
